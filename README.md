# Stream Offer

StreamOffer is an AI-driven, real-time offer recommendation system built for telecommunication providers to sell package to their customer.

It continuously ingests user activity streams — such as browsing behavior, data consumption, and app usage — using Kafka and processes them in Flink to dynamically segment users. By applying machine learning models on this live data, StreamOffer identifies user personas like gamers, streamers, social users, etc., and automatically triggers personalized data or service offers in real time.

This enables telcos to shift from static marketing campaigns to adaptive, event-driven engagement, increasing offer relevance, improving user satisfaction, and boosting ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).
